    <h2 class="text-2xl">About this site</h2>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">This is a community-maintained list of companies and organizations using Laravel, with an emphasis on showing <em>real-life</em> projects (not just a bunch of Laravel-focused developer tools).</p>
    <p>What belongs here?</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>No packages or other code</li>
        <li>No individual courses or books or other training resources</li>
        <li>If it's a developer-focused SaaS, it needs to be large--think Fathom Analytics, not someone's passion side project</li>
        <li>We have a bias against tools that are <em>only</em> targeted at Laravel developers, because those tools won't add any impact to folks' understanding how Laravel is used in the broader world</li>
        <li>Agencies are only allowed if they also have products, and are here to show their products</li>
        <li>Marketing sites for individual developers or agencies aren't allowed as sites examples</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="dark:text-gray-300 text-gray-600">This site is under active development as of June 2024. What you're seeing right now is not the real site, it's just a staging version of what's to come as we figure out the architecture and scope.</p>

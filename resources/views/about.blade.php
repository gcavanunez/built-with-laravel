    <h2 class="text-2xl">About this site</h2>

    <div class="max-w-5xl text-lg">

        <p class="mb-4">This is manually curated list of companies and organizations using Laravel, with an emphasis on showing <em>real-life</em> projects (not just a bunch of Laravel-focused developer tools). Our goal isn't to get as many sites in here as possible; it's to show people who are unsure about Laravel what it can be used for.</p>
        <p class="font-bold">What belongs here?</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Companies and non-profits using Laravel to do or support the work of their organization (whether that's "make profit" or "teach healthcare" or whatever else)</li>
            <li>No packages or other code</li>
            <li>No individual courses or books or other training resources</li>
            <li>If it's a developer-focused SaaS, it needs to be large--think Fathom Analytics, not someone's passion side project</li>
            <li>We have a bias against tools that are <em>only</em> targeted at Laravel developers, because those tools won't add any impact to folks' understanding how Laravel is used in the broader world</li>
            <li>Agencies are only allowed if they also have products, and are here to show their products</li>
            <li>Marketing sites for individual developers or agencies aren't allowed as sites examples</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="dark:text-gray-300 text-gray-600">This site is under active development as of June 2024. What you're seeing right now is not the real site, it's just a staging version of what's to come as we figure out the architecture and scope.</p>
